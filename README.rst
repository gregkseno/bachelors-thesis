Abstract
========

Any news can greatly affect the rates of investment instruments, so understanding them is very important for every investor. The task of analyzing news is often very difficult even for experienced investors, regarding beginners, at best, it can alienate investments, and at worst threaten to lose capital. Due to the fact that the number of newcomers in this field has almost doubled over the past year, this article is relevant in our time. To solve this problem, a machine learning model has been developed that determines the tonality and, consequently, simplifies the analysis of news. Thus, this article discusses and compares various approaches to building a tonal analyzer of economic news.
